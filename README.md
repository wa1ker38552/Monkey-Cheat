# Monkey-Cheat
Cheats for Monketype

If you run this script, you WILL get banned if you set it over 150 WPM several times. This script is caught by MonkeType as a bot. I can't seem to fix it but if your speed is under 150 WPM in settings, it shouldn't ever get flagged. 

**Setup**
1. Install chromium version that matches your chrome version
2. Put in your password and username in the script
3. Run the `complete_test` function with the first parameter being time (15, 30, 60, 120) and the second being wpm
4. MAKE SURE TO SET THE VARIABLES WITH THE #IMPORTANT COMMENT NEXT TO THEM. TO GET MAX_WPM, SET THE WPM TO 9999+ AND CHECK WHAT MONKEYTYPE SAYS. TO GET THE MAX CHARS, RUN THE TEST AT MAX SPEED AND SEE WHAT MONKEYTYPE SAYS, THE FORMAT IS CHARS/x/x/x AT THE BOTTOM
